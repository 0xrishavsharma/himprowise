He further supported an A Class Government Contractor as a Design and Site Engineer.\n\nSince 2018, Shubham has been an active ecosystem player in the hospitality sector of the Dalhousie region, running his own homestay in Banikhet, Dalhousie, which facilitated him to deeply connect with the culture, people, and landscape of Chamba district.\n\nWhile engaging with travelers and exploring the region over the years, he observed a clear gap in sustainable developmentâ€”particularly in rural entrepreneurship, waste management, and community-driven solutions. This realization became a turning point, motivating him to step beyond hospitality and contribute meaningfully to the region's future.\n\nAs the Co-Founder of Himprowise Solution Partners, he is committed to building a community ecosystem that empowers people at the grassroots, promotes innovation in rural livelihoods, and addresses the environmental and social challenges of our times through awareness and required handholding & technology interventions support.",
